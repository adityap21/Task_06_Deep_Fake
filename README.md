# Task 06 – Deep Fake / AI Street Interview

## Overview
This task builds on **Task 05 (NBA Player Analysis)** by transforming the narrative insights into an AI-generated “street interview.”  
The main focus was to **document the workflow**: tools attempted, prompts used, challenges faced, and results.

## Script Used
From Task 05 results, I created a short interview script.  
Due to clip length limits in Google Vids, the first attempt focused on one question and answer:

**Interviewer:** Who was last season’s top scorer in the NBA?  
**Interviewee:** Joel Embiid — he led the league with 33.1 points per game.  

The scene was set outside the **JMA Wireless Dome at Syracuse University**.
