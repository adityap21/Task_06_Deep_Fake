📄 Documentation – Task 06: Deep Fake / AI Street Interview
🎯 Goal
The goal of this task was to transform the narrative insights from Task 05 (NBA player stats analysis) into an AI-generated “street interview” format, experimenting with free AI media tools.
The focus was less on the quality of the final video and more on documenting the process, tools used, and challenges faced.

📝 Step 1 – Script Preparation
	•	I reviewed my Task 05 analysis results:
	◦	Joel Embiid = top scorer (33.1 PPG).
	◦	Luka Dončić = best all-around player (≈49 combined points + rebounds + assists).
	•	I wrote a conversational street interview script:
	◦	Interviewer asks a question.
	◦	AI interviewee responds naturally.
	•	To keep within Google Vids’ short clip length (~8 seconds), I limited the script to one question and answer: “Who was last season’s top scorer in the NBA?” “Joel Embiid — he led the league with 33.1 points per game.” 

🛠️ Step 2 – Tool Selection
I considered several free tools:
	•	D-ID / HeyGen (avatar-based video, free credits but watermarked).
	•	ElevenLabs / Murf.ai (audio-only, realistic voices).
	•	CapCut (video editing, could overlay audio on stock footage).
	•	ChatGPT audio mode (simple text-to-speech, no visuals).
I ultimately chose Google Vids (Veo 3) because:
	•	It provides text-to-video generation with synchronized audio.
	•	It allowed me to set the scene (outside JMA Wireless Dome at Syracuse University).
	•	Free tier was enough for a short clip.

🎬 Step 3 – Video Generation in Google Vids
	•	Opened Google Vids via vids.new.
	•	Entered a descriptive prompt: “Create a short street interview video outside the JMA Wireless Dome at Syracuse University. A reporter holds a microphone and asks: ‘Who was last season’s top scorer in the NBA?’ The fan responds: ‘Joel Embiid — he led the league with 33.1 points per game.’ Keep it upbeat with light campus background noise.” 
	•	Selected a casual avatar and default AI voice.
	•	Generated a short clip (~8 sec).

📂 Step 4 – Results
	•	Output: A short “street interview” clip with an AI avatar responding.
	•	Strengths:
	◦	Natural voice and smooth lip-sync.
	◦	Recognizable “interview” feel.
	◦	Easy to generate without coding.
	•	Limitations:
	◦	Length restriction (≈8 seconds).
	◦	Some lag and delay in rendering.
	◦	Limited customization for gestures/background.

🧪 Step 5 – Reflection
	•	Process Takeaway: Even a simple AI tool like Google Vids can quickly transform text into a realistic “deep fake” interview.
	•	Challenges: Video length and customization.
	•	Next Steps:
	◦	Create multiple one-question clips and stitch them together.
	◦	Try audio-only tools (ElevenLabs) for more flexibility.
	◦	Experiment with adding subtitles using CapCut.
